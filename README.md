# Dodge The Cars

## Description
Hey there, welcome to my first-ever personal project! I'm super excited to share with you the game I've been working on - a cool 2D adventure built with C++ and the amazing Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library.

## Introduction
As a huge fan of classic pixelated games, I wanted to create something that brings back that nostalgic charm. With this project, I've embarked on a journey to design a unique gaming experience that captures the magic of retro gaming.

## Features
Engaging 2D gameplay<br>
Mesmerizing pixel art backgrounds<br>
Animated objects using tileset and tilemap<br>

Thank You<br>
Thanks a bunch for checking out my first personal project! I hope you enjoy playing the game as much as I enjoyed creating it. Your support and feedback mean a lot to me. Let's have a blast in this pixelated world of adventure together! ðŸŽ®ðŸ˜Š

Happy gaming!<br>
